# NASA Global Temperature Data Analysis

## Description

This project analyzes data from NASA's [Global Land-Ocean Temperature Index](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/) which spans from 1880 to 2022. The dataset provides insights into changes in global temperatures over the years, helping to understand patterns and trends.
The dataset presents two sets of data points:
- **No Smoothing**: This set displays the raw, unaltered data points providing a direct representation of temperature readings.
- **Lowess**: This is a data smoothing technique that creates a smoother curve. It helps reveal underlying trends and patterns in the data while reducing the impact of noise or short-term fluctuations.

The project calculates various metrics like averages, medians, and standard deviations for both datasets. It then provides a combined report that aids in understanding and comparing the trends from the two data sets.
